    abstract = {Flow volumes are the volumetric equivalent of stream lines. They provide more information about the vector field being visualized than do stream lines or ribbons. Presented is an efficient method for producing flow volumes, composed of transparently rendered tetrahedra, for use in an interactive system. The problems of rendering, subdivision, sorting, compositing artifacts, and user interaction are dealt with. Efficiency comes from rendering only the volume of the smoke, and using hardware texturing and compositing.},

         abstract = {Accurately interpreting three dimensional (3D) vector quantities output as solutions to high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations can be an arduous, time-consuming task. Scientific visualization of these fields can be a powerful aid in their understanding. However, numerous pitfalls present themselves ranging from computational performance to the challenge of generating insightful visual representations of the data. In this paper, we briefly survey current practices for visualizing 3D vector fields, placing particular emphasis on those data arising from CFD simulations of turbulence. We describe the capabilities of a vector field visualization system that we have implemented as part of an open source visual data analysis environment. We also describe a novel algorithm we have developed for illustrating the advection of one vector field by a second flow field. We demonstrate these techniques in the exploration of two sets of runs. The first comprises an ideal and a resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. This set is used to test the validity of the advection scheme. The second corresponds to a simulation of MHD turbulence. We show the formation of structures in the flows, the evolution of magnetic field lines, and how field line advection can be used effectively to track structures therein. },

	Abstract = {Flow visualization has been a very attractive component of scientific visualization research for a long time.Usually very large multivariate datasets require processing. These datasets often consist of a large number of sample locations and several time steps. The steadily increasing performance of computers has recently become a driving factor for a reemergence in flow visualization research, especially in texture-based techniques. In this paper, dense, texture-based flow visualization techniques are discussed. This class of techniques attempts to provide
a complete, dense representation of the flow field with high spatio-temporal coherency. An attempt of categorizing closely related solutions is incorporated and presented. Fundamentals are shortly addressed as well as advantages and disadvantages of the methods},
